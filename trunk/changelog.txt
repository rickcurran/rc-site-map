# Changelog 

## 1.4

- Updated the url of the website for the plugin and clarify compatibility up to WordPress 5.7.2

## 1.3

- Removed limitation for custom post types to have to be hierarchical ('page' capability). This required a reasonably big change to the underlying code but any existing shortcodes should function as before, however it is worth reading the notes of the plugin as there are some changes that improve the functions of the shortcode. This underlying change will also enable some future improvements to the functionality of the plugin. 

## 1.2

- Updated PayPal donation link
- Fixed typo on donation link settings

## 1.1

- Added 'heading_class' attribute to shortcode to enable a custom class to be added to the optional list heading.
- Updated documentation to include more detail about CSS classes and styling.

## 1.0

- Added some additional attributes to provide more of the capabilities of `wp_list_pages` such as 'child_of', 'exclude', 'include' etc.

## 0.9

- Initial plugin build.
